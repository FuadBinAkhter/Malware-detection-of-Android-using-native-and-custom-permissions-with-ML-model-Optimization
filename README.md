# Overview
Due to the rapid expansion of Android apps and their global appeal in the smartphone market, it has become an accessible and straightforward target for malware. 
Although numerous updates have been made to fix the vulnerabilities of the Android operating system, malware applications have also evolved and upgraded in response to this change. 
This work investigates and classifies benign and malicious Android permissions as features for machine learning (ML) classifiers.
